Some of the eight problems were removed after the competition and I did not back them up.

1. problem #1 - currency arbitrage (10/10) - python - 7/10/2016

   Straightforward.

2. problem #2 - fixed-income security trade allocation (20/20) - python - 7/10/2016

   Detail-heavy, but straightforward.

3. problem #7 - trade analysis (60/60) - python, with alternate solution - 3/12/2017

   We use calculus and dynamic programming. We can prove correctness by induction.

4. problem #5 - employee stock grants (50/50) - python - 3/14/2017

   We use topological ordering.

5. problem #6 - audit sale (60/60) - python - 3/15/2017

   We use a unary metric and two heaps. We use dynamic programming to find optimal divider location.

6. problem #8 - perfect separating (80/80) - java - 3/16/2017

   We use dynamic programming to share work between different search tree branches and use built-in data-types as bit vectors.
